	<!--HCM Explanation-->
	<h1>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h1>
	<h2>Learn about this disease!</h2>
	The heart pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients that are critical to sustaining life. <br>
	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition that develops when the walls of the heart become thicker, <br>
	which in turn reduces the amount of blood that can be pumped with each heartbeat. <br>
	HCM can cause chest pain and abnormal heart rhythms, and can eventually contribute to strokes and heart failure.<br>
	It is estimated that 1 in 500 people have HCM, though many are undiagnosed. To identify genetic factors associated with HCM,<br>
	this study examined the genomes of over 50,000 individuals of different ethnicities. <br>
	The researchers discovered 12 genetic variants, 11 of which have not been previously connected to HCM risk.<br>
	Among the genes found linked to HCM was FHOD3. It encodes a protein that supports the formation of contracting fibers inside heart muscle cells.

Google Q&A: <br><br><br>

What is the life expectancy of someone with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

The long-term outcome for people with HCM is very good and most patients with HCM have normal life expectancy without significant 
limitations or complications. A small number of people with HCM, however, are at risk for complications including heart failure and sudden death.

What is the most common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

HCM is usually caused by an inherited genetic variant (familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What triggers cardiomyopathy?

Cardiomyopathy can be caused by your genes, other medical conditions, or extreme stress. It can also happen or get worse during pregnancy. 
Many times, the cause is not known. Treatments include medicines, procedures, and implanted devices.

What is the most common age for cardiomyopathy?

This occurs most often in adults ages 20 to 60. It is more common in men than women, but has been diagnosed in people of all ages, 
including children. Most people eventually develop heart failure.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What is the best treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

Medications to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and its symptoms might include:

Beta blockers such as metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL) or atenolol (Tenormin)
Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Verelan, Calan SR,) or diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Can anxiety cause cardiomyopathy?

Stress cardiomyopathy is a condition caused by intense emotional or physical stress leading to rapid and severe reversible cardiac dysfunction.
It mimics myocardial infarction with changes in the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, but without any obstructive coronary artery disease.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

How fast does hypertrophic cardiomyopathy progress?

Although HCM has 4 identified stages, patients with HCM can experience a sudden cardiac arrest or the disease can slowly
progress over several years.
